Q2:-



To improve the Stability we can impose a check where the developers can only do feature deployments once a week
There will only be production bug fixed that will go on-demand. That way we can increase the liabiility of system

The load time for changes should be immediate so the latest changes do reflect in production without failure, each pod should have same code and the cache should be updated too

The resource time allocation should be very less so as soon as the pod dies the new pod should replace it.

The change failure rate should be 0-2% so there is any failure order detected, it will raise flags.





Q3:-  

I tried to run the docker image on my local and it is working fine for me. kindly check it!
